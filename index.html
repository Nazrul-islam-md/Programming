            <h3>I'm Md. Nazrul Islam, a Front-end Developer</h3>
            <p>I have successfully completed my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Engineering from North South University, Dhaka, Bangladesh. Among the courses, I found Web releted courses were more interesting, so besides the academic courses, to gain practical knowledge, I got myself admitted into Web Design and Development course which was fully funded by Bangladesh Government and effectively completed the course.</p>
